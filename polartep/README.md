This folder contains required files to create a processor at polartep.io. The processor is already available to anyone with a user account, so there is no need to publish your own, unless you have done any modifications.


#### Credentials:
Credentials are added to the container by copying the "scihub_credentials.txt". Make a copy of the one you have in the parent directory to this directory to make it available to the docker build routine.
